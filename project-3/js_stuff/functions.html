  <h1>JavaScript Functions</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <h2>What is a Function?</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. 
      Functions help keep your code organized, make it easier to maintain, and prevent repetition. 
      Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can wrap it inside a function and call it whenever needed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="history">
    <h2>When Were Functions Introduced?</h2>
    <p>
      Functions have existed in JavaScript since its very first version back in 1995. 
      They were inspired by functions in other programming languages like C. 
      Over time, JavaScript functions evolved with new features such as 
      <strong>arrow functions</strong> (introduced in ES6, 2015), which provide shorter and cleaner syntax.

  </div>

  <div class="why-use">
    <h2>Why Are Functions Useful?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Write code once, use it multiple times.</li>
      <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Break down complex problems into smaller pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Code becomes easier to understand and debug.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Functions can take input (parameters) and return output (results).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="syntax">
    <h2>Basic Syntax of a Function</h2>
    <p>
      The traditional way to create a function looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can then call the function like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
console.log(greet("Alex")); // Output: Hello, Alex!
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="arrow-functions">
    <h2>Arrow Functions (Modern Syntax)</h2>
    <p>
      ES6 introduced arrow functions, which are shorter and more concise:
    </p>
    <pre>
const greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name + "!";
console.log(greet("Maya")); // Output: Hello, Maya!
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript programs. 
      Without them, your code would be messy, repetitive, and hard to maintain. 
      Learning how to define and use functions effectively is one of the most important steps 
      in becoming a strong JavaScript developer.
